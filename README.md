# Google-OR-Bin-Packing

For a group project, we had decided to use Linear Optimization to optimize AWS S3's buckets based off of different file types and cost tiering. This personal project is based off of that and uses `Google OR` to solve a bin packing problem from
Amazon's perspective. The project looks to create an optimal solution for AWS to store different types of data in different regions and generates a solution for each region based off of the number of servers available. The mathematical 
theory behind this project is derived on Linear and Integer Programming and in terms of technology, I used the MPSolver to compute the solution. The project was also presented in the form of a Google Colab notebook.
